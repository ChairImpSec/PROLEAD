 * @brief Represents a probe that records the stable signal driven by a wire
 * during a single clock cycle.
 *
 * The Probe class is used to capture the value of a specific signal at a
 * particular clock cycle. Probes can be extended based on a propagation
 * procedure to generate a list of Probe elements. Unlike the Propagation class,
 * the Probe class includes a notion of time (i.e., the clock cycle) in which
 * the signal is recorded. It does not store the propagation procedure.
 *
 * @note Probes are comparable, and comparisons prioritize the clock cycle over
 * the signal index.
